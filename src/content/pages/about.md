I'm motivated frontend developer with a deep passion for crafting user-centric interfaces. I possess a strong user empathy, consistently approaching software development from the user's perspective. I believe in the power of technology to positively impact lives, fostering seamless integration into daily workflows across various industries. My goal is to create impactful software solutions that empower users and enhance their experience.

###### Quality

Championing User-Centered Design: I thrive in environments that demand innovative solutions.  My focus extends beyond functionality to ensure software is both scalable and user-friendly. I act as a bridge between business requirements and user needs, fostering positive interactions through intuitive and engaging user interfaces.

###### Commitment

Another key player, for both creating new software or maintaining existing up-and-running applications.

when kick-off a new application there are hidden gems along the way like exploring the idea, validating the requirements and available resources, and watching the growing up as a baby from POC to first release.. it is fun apart from the commitment.

maintaining existing software can be a little less fun than starting one from scratch but it is still a challenge and opportunity to fix, learn, and develop.

###### Agility

It is another power skill. so across humble experience in software development with teams and cultures around the globe, startups, and enterprises, on-site and remote environments, and even solo or leading a team. finally within the fast-growing tech ecosystem and variety of tools and technologies. so the Agility to adopt or handle any of this can be fun and target a good impact by the end.
